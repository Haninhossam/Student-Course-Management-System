# Student Course Management System

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the "Student Course Management System" SQL project. This project involves creating a database to manage student courses, including setting up tables for students, courses, enrollments, and instructors. The project covers various SQL concepts, such as selection, filtering, aggregation, joins, and subqueries. This README provides a comprehensive guide to the project, including installation instructions for Microsoft SQL Server and steps to execute the project.

## 2. Installing Microsoft SQL Server

To start working on this project, you need to install Microsoft SQL Server and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) on your PC. Follow these steps:

### 2.1 Download Microsoft SQL Server

2. Choose the appropriate edition:
   - **Express Edition**: Suitable for beginners.
   - **Developer Edition**: Includes advanced features.
3. Click "Download now" and run the downloaded installer.

### 2.2 Install Microsoft SQL Server

1. Select the installation type:
   - **Basic**: A quick installation with default settings.
   - **Custom**: Allows you to configure features and settings.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
3. During setup, configure the SQL Server instance. You can either accept the default settings or customize them according to your needs.

### 2.3 Download and Install SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

1. Download SSMS from the [SQL Server Management Studio Download](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms) page.

## 3. Project Overview

### 3.1 Objective

The goal of the "Student Course Management System" project is to design a functional database that manages students, courses, enrollments, and instructors. This project serves as an educational tool to practice and enhance SQL skills.

### 3.2 Database Structure

The database comprises four primary tables:

- **Students**: Stores student details including name, email, and date of birth.
- **Courses**: Contains information about courses such as name and description.
- **Instructors**: Manages instructor information, including name and email.
- **Enrollments**: Tracks student enrollments in courses and the date of enrollment.

### 3.3 Project Execution

The project involves:
- Creating the database and tables.
- Populating the tables with sample data.
- Executing a range of SQL queries, from basic to advanced, to explore data manipulation, table joins, and the use of functions and stored procedures.

### 3.4 Key SQL Concepts Covered

- **Selection and Filtering**: Retrieving specific data based on conditions.
- **Aggregation**: Calculating totals, averages, minimums, and maximums.
- **Joins**: Combining data from multiple tables based on related columns.
- **Subqueries**: Performing complex operations with nested queries.
- **Stored Procedures and Functions**: Encapsulating SQL logic for reuse.
- **Set Operations**: Combining results from multiple queries.
